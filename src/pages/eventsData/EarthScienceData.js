      "In Astronomy, teams answer questions on math and physics relating to the year's topics (low/mid mass variable stars and stellar evolution for 2022 season). Some questions pertain to specific objects on the year's DSO (Deep Space Object) list. Test questions in Astronomy frequently rely on a significant amount of background knowledge - hence, gathering information on topics tangentially related to the rules may be beneficial. The DSO list can be accessible through the link provided below.",

      "During the 2022 season, this event will focus on physical and geological oceanography. Physical oceanography is primarily concerned with the ocean as a physical system in which principles like conservation of mass, energy, momentum and spin play a huge role in determining what you see. Geological oceanography looks at the rocks and sediments on the ocean bottom and margins and tries to infer how that got that way and what that tells us about the history of the earth.",
