      "This event tests student's knowledge of time and their skill in building a timekeeping device. The test portion covers general topics in the physics and history of time, with everything in between. The second portion involves a timekeeping device to determine the amount of time, between 10 and 300 seconds (5 minutes), with a precision of 0.1 seconds. Please note, this is the best event in existence. It's About Time, It's About Power. We Stay Hungry. We Devour.",
